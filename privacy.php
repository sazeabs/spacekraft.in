            <li>
                <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies,

                    technologies on the SpaceKraft Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf.
                    While
                    you
                    may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, it may affect your ability to log in

                    your

                    signal
                    in
                    the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how
                    that
                    signal should be interpreted.</p>

                    <li>(iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of SpaceKraft override your own.</li>

            <li><p>Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask SpaceKraft to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@spacekraft.in">support@spacekraft.in</a>.</p></li>
