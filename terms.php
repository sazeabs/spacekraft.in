            receive rental payments of any kind, directly or indirectly, or enter into any real estate related agreement

            authorized agents. This restriction shall survive termination of this agreement for a reasonable period of
            thirty-six (36) months thereafter. </p>

            that such amounts shall be due immediately upon said breach. Joint and several liability for breach under
            this provision may apply to any and all users, either Space Owners or Occupants, based on SpaceKraft’s sole
            discretion and assessment of the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of circumvention. </p>

        <h2>Space Owners </h2>
        <p>If you (“Space Owner”) use the Services on behalf of a company or other organization, you represent and
            warrant that you are authorized to bind such company or organization to these Terms and to act on behalf of
            such company with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Services and, in such event, “you”
            and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. If you post listings, accept
            Occupant’s bookings, or similarly represent that you have an ownership interest in a particular property,
            you represent and warrant that you possess an ownership interest in that property, or are authorized to act
            on behalf of someone who possesses such an interest. You agree to respond promptly and completely to
            requests from SpaceKraft for additional information that SpaceKraft deems necessary to determine your
            authority to act on behalf of a company or organization. SpaceKraft may suspend or terminate your access to
            the Services and your account if SpaceKraft has reason to believe that you are not authorized to act on
            behalf of a company or organization for whom you claim to be acting in connection with the Services.</p>
        <p>As a Space Owner, you may create Listings. You will be required to provide information about the commercial
            space to be listed including location, capacity, size, features, availability of the commercial space,
            pricing and related rules and financial terms. Unless you specifically request that your Listing(s) be kept
            offline, your Listing(s) will be made publicly available via our Website, Phone Application and Services.
            Other Members will be able to book your commercial space via the Website, Phone Application and Services
            based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once an occupant requests
            a booking of your commercial space, the price for the booking may not be altered. If you request that your
            listing be kept offline, SpaceKraft will keep your listing information in its internal database and contact
            you if your property may be suitable for a particular renter’s needs. </p>
        <p>SpaceKraft does not require exclusivity or restrict your opportunities to list your space with any broker or
            similar online marketing platform. However, in consideration for SpaceKraft’s investment in marketing your
            space, by creating a Listing with SpaceKraft you agree to adjust your Listing price as necessary to ensure
            that it is not advertised as available at a lower price for short-term rental on any competing platform for
            popup retail space. </p>
        <p>By creating a Listing you represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul>

                <p>You have sufficient rights in and to the commercial space to participate in the Service as a Space
                    Owner, and
                    your participation in the Service as a Space Owner will not violate any law or regulations or result
                    in the
                    breach of any agreement between you and any third party, including any lease agreement or other
                    agreement
                    relating to the space; </p>

            <li>
                <p>Any space you offer for bookings through SpaceKraft is free of any known conditions or defects that

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To respond promptly and completely to renters’ inquiries and questions, as well as requests from

            </li>
            <li>

                    or
                    other) regardless of who is performing and/or the duration of such work, when such work has any
                    impact on
                    the commercial space, including but not limited to work affecting the visibility, area, capacity,
                    availability and/or occupants’ access to the commercial space;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>That you are responsible for any and all Listings you post, and the bookings, occupancies or

                    you host.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Please note that SpaceKraft assumes no responsibility for a Space Owner’s compliance with any applicable
            laws, rules and regulations. SpaceKraft reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to limit
            or disable a Space Owner’s access to the site, including by removing Listings for any reason, such as
            Listings that SpaceKraft, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation
            of these Terms or otherwise harmful to our Website, Phone Application or Services.</p>
        <p>You understand and agree that SpaceKraft does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a
            Space Owner. If an occupant requests a booking of your commercial space and occupies your commercial space,
            any agreement you enter into with such occupant is between you and the occupant and SpaceKraft is not a
            party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpaceKraft serves as the limited authorized agent of the Space
            Owner for the purpose of accepting payments from occupant on behalf of the Space Owner and is responsible
            for transmitting such payments to the Space Owner. Each Space Owner is responsible for determining
            applicable Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to
            applicable Taxes in their Listings.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that, as a Space Owner, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are
            also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who work at or are otherwise present at the
            commercial space at your request or invitation. In this regard, if the Space Owner has failed to inform
            SpaceKraft and the Occupant in writing of the existence of planned work or work in progress at the Space
            made available on the Platform, and the Space has been booked by said Occupant without knowledge of such
            planned work or work in progress, the Space Owner agrees to fully refund any License Fee or other sums
            collected in exchange for the use of the Space (including any Service Fee that the Occupant has paid to
            SpaceKraft) in the event that said Occupant wish to cancel its reservation for this reason, regardless of
            the specific terms of the Cancellation Policy that would otherwise apply. SpaceKraft recommends that Space
            Owners obtain appropriate insurance for their commercial spaces. Please review any insurance policy that you
            may have for your commercial space carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with
            and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including
            whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of occupants (and the clients the
            occupants invite to the commercial space, if applicable) while at your commercial space.</p>
        <p>By renting your space through SpaceKraft, you agree to carefully document the condition of the space shortly
            before any renters take occupancy and after they vacate the premises. Failure to document the condition of
            the space may preclude a space owner's claim against damage deposits or insurance policies.</p>
        <p>You further acknowledge and agree that in all Space-Sharing Agreements, you will abide by the Cancellation
            Policy, Security Deposit Policy, Commonly Restricted Uses Policy.</p>

        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <h2>Cancellations by Space Owners </h2>
        <p>After a booking is made with SpaceKraft, a Space Owner may cancel at any time, subject to the following
            terms: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Should the Space Owner cancel before the Move-In Date, Space Owner shall refund to the Occupant (i)
                    any and
                    all funds received under this Agreement; (ii) refund to the Occupant SpaceKraft's fee which have
                    been paid
                    by the latter to SpaceKraft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is expressly mentioned that SpaceKraft's fee will be kept by SpaceKraft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Should the Space Owner cancel on the Move-In Date or at any time thereafter, it shall only do so with
                    thirty
                    (30) days prior written notice to the Occupant, and Space Owner shall pay to Occupant all of the
                    following:
                    (1) a refund, at a pro rata amount, for all days less than the full term which the Occupant cannot
                    occupy
                    the Space due to the Space Owner’s early termination; (2) a sum recognized as Early Revocation
                    Damages for
                    costs related to the Occupant’s being forced to vacate the premises prematurely, equal to a pro rata
                    amount
                    for all days less than the full term which the Occupant cannot occupy the Space due to the Space
                    Owner’s
                    early termination. This sum will equal the refund required provided in (a) of this Section but paid
                    in
                    addition to the refund; (3) a fee equal to 20% of the total amount due under this agreement to
                    recompense
                    the Occupant of the SpaceKraft’s fee, which shall not be refunded.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cancellation by Occupants</h2>
        <p>After a booking is made with SpaceKraft, an Occupant may cancel within twenty-four hours after booking, or
            any time more than thirty (30) days prior to the Move-In Date, subject to the following terms: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Should the Occupant cancel thirty (30) days or more in advance of the Move-In Date, Occupant shall be
                    entitled to a 50% refund of it’s License Fee (the amount paid under the booking except for
                    SpaceKraft’s
                    Service Fee).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Occupants may not cancel less than thirty (30) days before the Move-In date, or after their Move-In
                    Date.
                    They must pay the full License Fee and Service Fee, regardless of whether or not they occupy the
                    space.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>It should be noted that the above-referenced cancellation restrictions may not be applicable in
                    certain
                    situations noted in these Terms, including but not limited to cases where the Space Owner has failed
                    to
                    notify the Occupant of planned work or work in progress affecting the commercial viability of the
                    Space.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mutual Cancellation</h2>
        <p>After a booking is made with SpaceKraft, an Occupant and Space Owner may mutually agree to cancel the booking
            at any time. In such cases, any license agreement, lease or similar agreement should be rescinded. All funds
            transferred as part of the booking should be refunded, except SpaceKraft’s Service Fee, which will be
            retained by SpaceKraft.</p>
        <h2>Rescission in Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p><em>SpaceKraft reserves the right to allow limited rescission (non-mutual cancellation) of bookings in
                special circumstances caused by natural disasters, epidemics, political crises, armed conflicts and
                other instances of force majeure </em>or Acts of God.
            SpaceKraft will announce application of this policy and related terms and conditions as such circumstances
            arise. The temporal or regional applicability of the policy will generally be contingent on the designations
            provided by government authorities or NGOs. For example, intergovernmental, national, territorial or
            state-level declarations of States of Emergency may trigger limited application of this policy, under the
            terms and conditions promulgated by SpaceKraft as such situations arise. The policy may rely on similar
            crisis designations issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Indian Centers for Disease Control
            and Prevention (CDC), or the United Nations.
            In such special circumstances, SpaceKraft may announce that, pursuant to this policy, any license
            agreements, lease or similar agreement may be rescinded at the request of one party, and all funds
            transferred as part of the booking should be refunded. Where applicable, SpaceKraft’s Service Fee may be
            refunded as well. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpaceKraft cannot guarantee that Listing Owners will comply
            with such policies and refund any license fees or deposits that have already been tendered, and SpaceKraft
            does not warrant such compliance. SpaceKraft will not reimburse Renters for Listing Owner’s failure to
            refund license fees or deposits in such circumstances.</p>
        <h2>Alternative Cancellation Terms Agreed to by Parties to a Booking</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing standard cancellation terms, Occupants and Space Owner can agree to alternative
            cancellation terms which, if made in writing, shall supersede SpaceKraft’s standard cancellation terms,
            except with regards to SpaceKraft’s Service Fee. In the event no specific terms to cancellation have been
            agreed upon in writing by an Occupant and a Space Owner, SpaceKraft’s standard cancellation policy shall
            govern. </p>
        <p>In any case, both Space Owners and Occupants are discouraged from cancelling and SpaceKraft might, at its
            discretion, disable your account or delist your commercial space following a cancellation.</p>
        <p>SpaceKraft has the right to cancel any booking at any time for security or fraud-protection purposes. This is
            generally due to our fraud-detection processes reporting a problem with the payment card submitted.</p>
        <h1>Default Lease</h1>
        <p>SpaceKraft strongly recommends that for all bookings made on its site, Space Owners and Occupants sign a
            license or lease to structure the terms of their space-sharing agreement. However, should the parties to a
            Space-sharing Agreement made through SpaceKraft fail to draft and sign a written agreement prior to Move-In,
            but without either party expressing an intention to cancel the agreement, the terms of the following Default
            Commercial Space License Agreement shall govern the transaction: </p>
        <div class="grey">
            <h2>DEFAULT COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE AGREEMENT</h2>
            <p>THIS COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is for an occupancy to commence on the
                [Move-In
                Date as listed in relevant communications on SpaceKraft’s booking platform] (hereinafter “Commencement
                Date”) and continue until [Move-Out Date as listed in relevant communications on SpaceKraft’s booking
                platform] (hereinafter “Move-Out Date”) and made by and between Occupant and Owner.</p>
            <p>Whereas OWNER, is the legal OWNER of the commercial space in question;</p>
            <p>Whereas OCCUPANT wishes to license the Space from OWNER for the following use: [Occupant’s Intended Use
                as
                listed in relevant communications on SpaceKraft’s booking platform] (the “Agreed-Upon Use”);</p>
            <p>Whereas OWNER wishes to license the Space to OCCUPANT upon the below terms and conditions, for a License
                Fee
                of ₹ [Space Owner’s Required Fee as listed in relevant communications on SpaceKraft’s booking platform]
                Indian Rupees, and with a Security Deposit of ₹ [Space Owner’s Required Deposit Amount as listed in
                relevant
                communications on SpaceKraft’s booking platform] Indian Rupees.</p>
            <p>Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable
                consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, OCCUPANT and OWNER hereby
                agree
                as follows:</p>
            <p>1. Occupancy of Space. Starting on the Commencement Date, in consideration of the License Fee, for a
                period
                of payable through the SpaceKraft platform. OWNER shall grant OCCUPANT a non-transferable license to use
                and
                occupy the Space during the Term (as defined below). The License Fee includes expenses for reasonable
                use of
                utilities such as electricity, water, heat, air conditioning and wireless internet, unless OWNER has
                previously disclosed that any of these utilities is unavailable in the Space or not included in the
                License
                Fee.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>2. Security Deposit. At the OWNER’s request, OCCUPANT shall remit a “Security Deposit” to the OWNER. The
                Security Deposit shall be held by OWNER without interest (unless otherwise required by law) and as
                security
                for the performance by OCCUPANT of its covenants and obligations under this Agreement, it being
                expressly
                understood that the Security Deposit shall not be considered a measure of OWNER's damages in case of
                Default. Unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, OWNER or its agent may
                commingle the Security Deposit with other funds. OWNER may, from time to time, without prejudice to any
                other remedy, use the Security Deposit to satisfy any covenant or obligation of OCCUPANT hereunder.
                Following any such application of the Security Deposit, OCCUPANT shall pay to OWNER on demand the amount
                so
                applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If OCCUPANT has not committed a
                Default that is continuing at the termination of this Agreement, the balance of the Security Deposit
                remaining after any such application shall be returned to OCCUPANT. If OWNER transfers its interest in
                the
                Space during the term of this Agreement, OWNER may assign the Security Deposit to the transferee and
                thereafter shall have no further liability for the return of such Security Deposit.
            </p>
            <p>3. Reasonable Use of Space. Non-interference with others.</p>
            <p>a. The Space may only be utilized for the agreed-upon USE that will be open both to the media and the
                general
                public. OCCUPANT shall not perform any work or undertake any other activity in the Space without the
                prior
                written consent of OWNER. In no event whatsoever, should OCCUPANT undertake any activity that would or
                may
                unreasonably interfere or disturb the use or occupancy of adjacent spaces by OWNER, its invitees or
                other
                occupants. OCCUPANT warrants that its Use of the Space shall comply with all applicable laws and
                regulations. OCCUPANT warrants that it possesses all necessary insurance coverage, including but not
                limited
                to Commercial General Liability insurance. OCCUPANT agrees that upon request by OWNER prior to
                Commencement
                Date, it shall furnish proof of insurance with a reasonable time. </p>
            <p>b. OCCUPANT also agrees that in good faith, it shall reasonably direct its employees, agents and invitees
                to
                respect the terms and conditions of this Agreement and not to interfere with the quiet enjoyment of
                other
                adjacent spaces by other occupants.</p>
            <p>4. Termination and Surrender.</p>
            <p>Early Termination (by OWNER). Notwithstanding the foregoing, OWNER has the right to terminate this
                Agreement,
                thereby revoking the OCCUPANT’s license to use the Space, at any time, subject to the notice
                requirements
                and contractual penalties herein. </p>
            <p>Should the OWNER exercise this right thirty (30) days or more in advance of the Commencement Date, OWNER
                shall refund to OCCUPANT any and all funds received under this Agreement. </p>
            <p>Should the OWNER exercise this right less than thirty (30) days before the Commencement Date, OWNER shall
                refund to OCCUPANT any and all funds received under this Agreement, as well as a fee equal to 20% of the
                amount due under this Agreement to recompense the OCCUPANT of the SpaceKraft’s fee, which shall not be
                refunded. </p>
            <p>Should the OWNER exercise this right on the Commencement Date or any time thereafter, it shall only do so
                with thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the OCCUPANT, and OWNER shall pay to OCCUPANT all of the
                following: (1) a refund, at a pro rata amount, for all days less than the full term which the OCCUPANT
                cannot occupy the Space due to the OWNER’s early termination; (2) a sum recognized as Early Revocation
                Damages for costs related to the OCCUPANT’s being forced to vacate the premises prematurely, equal to a
                pro
                rata amount for all days less than the full term which the OCCUPANT cannot occupy the Space due to the
                OWNER’s early termination. This sum will equal the refund required provided in (a) of this Section but
                paid
                in addition to the refund; (3) a fee equal to 20% of the total amount due under this agreement to
                recompense
                the OCCUPANT of the SpaceKraft’s fee, which shall not be refunded; </p>
            <p>Early Termination (by OCCUPANT). Notwithstanding the foregoing, OCCUPANT has the right to terminate this
                Agreement at any time prior to thirty (30) days before the Commencement Date. </p>
            <p>Should the OCCUPANT exercise this right thirty (30) days or more in advance of the Commencement Date,
                OCCUPANT shall be entitled to a refund of fifty percent (50%) of funds paid under this Agreement. (Such
                refund shall not include SpaceKraft’s fee.)</p>
            <p>The OCCUPANT shall have no right to cancel after thirty (30) days prior to the Commencement Date.</p>
            <p>Surrender. Upon the natural expiration or termination of this Agreement, OCCUPANT shall surrender to
                OWNER
                the Space in the same condition existing on the date hereof (subject to reasonable wear and tear), and
                OCCUPANT shall remove all of its property located in the Space, if any, provided, that upon such
                termination
                or expiration, OCCUPANT shall have no right to the property of OWNER. </p>
            <p> 5. Condition of the Space. OCCUPANT states that it has made a thorough inspection of the Space and
                agrees to
                take the same in its condition "as is" as of the date hereof and OWNER shall have no obligation to
                alter,
                improve or decorate the Space for OCCUPANT's use and occupancy. OCCUPANT shall not make or allow any
                alterations, installations, improvements, additions or other physical changes in or about the Space
                without

            <p>6. Access. OWNER and OWNER' agents shall have the right, throughout the Term, to enter any portion of the
                Space upon prior reasonable verbal notice to OCCUPANT to examine the same, and to make such repairs,
                alterations, improvements or additions as OWNER may deem reasonably necessary.</p>
            <p>7. No Tenancy. OCCUPANT acknowledges that this is a revocable license for a limited use, and nothing in
                this
                agreement shall constitute a leasehold interest or tenancy or conveyance of any exclusive possessory
                interest in the property. OCCUPANT shall not permit any liens to be filed against the Premises for any
                other
                cause or reason. In the event liens are filed, then OCCUPANT shall promptly cause the same to be
                released,
                bonded or satisfied in full within ten (10) days of the date of such filing.</p>
            <p>8. Default. If OCCUPANT shall fail to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement and such
                non-compliance continues for more than 5 days after notice by OWNER to OCCUPANT of such non-compliance,
                or
                if such non-compliance is of such a nature that it can be remedied but cannot be completely remedied
                within
                5 days, OCCUPANT fails to commence to remedy such non-compliance within 5 days after such notice; or,
                with
                respect to any such non-compliance, OCCUPANT, having commenced such remedy within 5 days after such
                notice,
                fails to diligently prosecute to completion all steps necessary to remedy such non-compliance within an
                additional 5 days, then OWNER shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice to OCCUPANT,
                and
                ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, this Agreement shall terminate, and OCCUPANT shall
                immediately quit and surrender the Space as required hereby. </p>
            <p>9. No Liability and Hold Harmless. OWNER shall have no liability or responsibility to OCCUPANT, and
                OCCUPANT
                shall have no claim against OWNER, for any damage or loss incurred by OCCUPANT with respect to property
                located in the Space, except as a result of the negligence or willful misconduct of OWNER.
                Notwithstanding
                anything to the contrary in this agreement and without prejudice to any other provision of this Section,
                OCCUPANT agrees to indemnify OWNER against, and hold OWNER harmless from, any loss, cost, expense,
                claims or
                demands (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising (i) by virtue of any accident, damage or injury
                to
                persons or property which may be in or upon, or be placed in or upon, the Space, (ii) by reason of
                occupation of the Space by OCCUPANT, its employees, invitees and agents, or (iii) by reason of
                OCCUPANT's
                breach of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. </p>
            <p>10. Commission. The Parties acknowledge that OCCUPANT was referred to OWNER through www.spacekraft.in and
                that they are both individually bound by The SpaceKraft’s Terms of Service. OCCUPANT warrants that it
                has
                paid, or upon signature of the Contract shall pay, a 10% Service Fee to SpaceKraft. The Parties agree to
                indemnify, defend and hold the other party and SpaceKraft harmless from and against any claim for other
                or
                additional broker's fees or finder's fees asserted by anyone other than by anyone other than SpaceKraft
                on
                account of any dealings with OCCUPANT or OWNER in connection with this Agreement, it being the parties’
                intention that SpaceKraft is a third party beneficiary of the terms of this Agreement. The Parties also
                agree in good faith, that during the Term of this Agreement and for a reasonable period of thirty-six
                (36)
                months thereafter, the Parties shall not attempt to bypass SpaceKraft, and shall therefore not attempt
                to
                contract directly or indirectly, lease, or enter directly or indirectly into any real estate related
                agreement or transaction with each other that would create of result in a lease, sale or a license to
                use a
                commercial space. In the event either Party breaches this specific reasonable covenant not to circumvent
                SpaceKraft, the Parties understand that SpaceKraft, would be at loss and suffer damages that would be
                hard
                to appraise and therefore acknowledge that SpaceKraft may at its sole discretion elect to hold either
                Party
                responsible for liquidated damages equal to three times the circumvented Service Fee, paid hereunder and
                due
                immediately upon said breach.</p>
            <p>11. Waiver. No waiver of any default of OWNER or OCCUPANT hereunder shall be implied from any omission to
                take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express
                waiver
                shall affect any default other than the default specified in the express waiver and that only for the
                time
                and to the extent therein stated. One or more waivers by OWNER or OCCUPANT shall not be construed as a
                waiver of a subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition.</p>
            <p> 12. Notices. All notices in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be effective upon
                receipt. Notices shall be delivered only by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid to
                the
                address of the parties as provided in this agreement. Either party may change its notice address upon
                notice
                to the other party in accordance with this Agreement. </p>
            <p>13. Counterparts; Electronic Signature. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
                each of
                which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
                instrument. The Grantee's electronic signature of this Agreement shall have the same validity and effect
                as
                a signature affixed by the Grantee's hand.</p>
            <p>14. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered by OCCUPANT
                without
                the prior written consent of OWNER, nor shall OCCUPANT permit or suffer any other business entity to use
                or
                occupy any portion of the Space.</p>
            <p>15. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed, construed and interpreted by, through and under the
                Laws
                of the State in which the Space is located.</p>
            <p>16. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only by a written instrument duly executed
                by
                all of the parties hereto.</p>
            <p>17. Severability. If any covenant, condition, provision, term or agreement of this Agreement is, to any
                extent, held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion thereof and all other covenants,
                conditions,
                provisions, terms and agreements of this Agreement, will not be affected by such holding, and will
                remain
                valid and in force to the fullest extent permitted by law.

        <p>Both parties to any booking made through SpaceKraft understand and acknowledge that their Space-sharing
            Agreement is a bilateral contract, made between Occupant and Space Owner, to which SpaceKraft is not a party
            (although it may be a Third-party Beneficiary). SpaceKraft disclaims all liability arising from or related
            to any such transactions to the fullest extent permitted by law. Both parties agree and acknowledge that
            they have carefully read and reviewed the language of the Default Commercial Space License Agreement, and
            have adopted its language as their own. SpaceKraft disclaims all liability arising from or related to the
            language of the Default Commercial Space License Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h1>Security Deposit Policy</h1>
        <p>SpaceKraft recommends, but does not require, that Space Owners collect Security Deposits from Occupants after
            a booking is made but before the Occupant occupies the space. A Security Deposit is intended as security for
            the performance by Occupant of its covenants and obligations under the parties’ agreement.</p>
        <p>Where a Security Deposit is collected, Space Owner agrees and acknowledges that their collection, retention
            and return of the funds will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations regarding such
            deposits. Space Owner further agrees and acknowledges Security Deposit shall not be considered a measure of
            Space Owner’s damages in case of default under the applicable lease or license agreement, unless so provided
            by the applicable lease or license agreement. </p>
        <p>When they tender a Security Deposit as part of a booking through SpaceKraft, Occupant agrees and acknowledges
            that such deposit will be held without interest, unless otherwise required by law or so provided by the
            applicable lease or license agreement. Occupant further agrees and acknowledges that unless otherwise
            provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, Space Owner or its agent may commingle the Security
            Deposit with other funds. </p>
        <p>Form of Deposit. A Security Deposit may be provided in any form agreed to by the parties as part of a
            Space-Sharing Agreement. Absent any contrary terms in a Space-Sharing Agreement, Space Owners should return
            such Security Deposit, minus any non-disputed retentions, to the Occupant in the form in which it was
            originally tendered, or any other form agreed to by the parties. </p>
        <p>Return of Deposit. Should a retention be made during the period of occupancy, provided there is no dispute
            regarding the retention, Occupant shall pay to Space Owner on demand the amount so applied in order to
            restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Such payment shall not constitute the waiver of a right
            to dispute the retention. If Occupant has not committed a Default that is continuing at the termination of
            the applicable lease or license agreement, the balance of the Security Deposit remaining after any such
            application shall be returned to Occupant within ten (10) days of the Move-Out Date.</p>
        <p>Retention of Security Deposit Funds. Space Owner may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other
            remedy under the Governing Space-Sharing Agreement, retain a portion or all of the Security Deposit to
            satisfy any covenant or obligation of Occupant under the applicable lease or license agreement. Upon such a
            retention, Space Owner agrees to: (1) comply with all applicable laws all applicable laws, rules, and
            regulations regarding such deposits, (2) notify the Occupant in writing of such retention, with a reasonably
            detailed description of the reason for such retention, (3) if the Occupant or the SpaceKraft so requests,
            provide additional documentation or evidence of any claimed damage to the property, fixtures or environs,
            (4) if the Occupant or SpaceKraft so requests, provide access to the Space in order for the Occupant or
            SpaceKraft to inspect any claimed damage. </p>
        <p>Disputes Related to Security Deposits. If a Space Owner and an Occupant cannot reach an agreement regarding a
            Space Owner’s claim to a Security Deposit retention, either party may escalate their claim to SpaceKraft for
            mediation of the dispute. SpaceKraft reserves the right to take action on behalf of an Occupant if a Space
            Owner’s retention of Security Deposit funds are, in SpaceKraft’s sole discretion, found to be unfair,
            unsubstantiated, unjust, frivolous or fraudulent. Such action may include limiting or disabling a Space
            Owner’s access to the site or removing relevant listings. In such cases, Occupants and Space Owners agree to
            cooperate with and assist SpaceKraft in good faith, and to provide SpaceKraft with such information and take
            such actions as may be reasonably requested by SpaceKraft, in connection with any Damage Claims or other
            complaints or claims made by Members relating to Space. Nonetheless, both Space Owners and Occupants agree
            and acknowledge that any disputes related to Security Deposits ultimately must be resolved between the
            parties in accordance with the terms of the governing Space-Sharing Agreement, to which SpaceKraft is not
            itself a party. SpaceKraft disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such transactions to the
            fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p>Transfer of Space Owner’s Interest. If Space Owner transfers its interest in a space during the term of a
            lease or license agreement booked through SpaceKraft, Space Owner may assign the Security Deposit to the
            transferee and thereafter shall have no further liability for the return of such Security Deposit, unless
            expressly prohibited by the applicable lease or license agreement. </p>

            liability; (c) might be considered offensive, frightening, or otherwise unusually objectionable to people in
